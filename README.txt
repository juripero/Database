This is a simple concurrent in-memory database written in Scala; data is not persistent (unless I feel like working on this again).

Once started, the database is accessed via a telnet connection to the localhost on one of 3 ports:

31733, 29001, or 43061

Theoretically, this database is inherently scalable and should allow for many simultaneous connections.

Example commands are contained in the test files.

Having a test file or "script" file of your own  in the database's directory will allow you to use "exec filename" when connected to the database.
This will parse the file executing each command contained within in succession.
